.Holding the ESP32-S2 with your left hand, pressing it onto the tinned solder pad

.You'll feel the ESP32-S2 sink into the solder when you touch it with your soldering iron

.Soldering a second pad diagonally across from the first...

.and then going around the ESP32-S2, soldering all the pads (including the first one again to freshen up the joint with some new fluxfootnote:[The bottom pad is not required as per the manufacturer's documentation]

.Next it's time to set the PCB aside and continue with the housing: Center punching the holes...
