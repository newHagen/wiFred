== Abstract

This document describes the usage and configuration of the wiFred - a very simple wireless throttle for model railroads to connect to wiThrottle servers like JMRI. It also contains schematics and BOMs for the device - for both LiPo battery versions in active development - as well as programming instructions and assembly tips, and also an overview of options for the server side of things.

The most recent version of this document can be found at https://newheiko.github.io/wiFred, https://github.com/newHeiko/wiFred/raw/master/documentation/docu_en.pdf and https://github.com/newHeiko/wiFred/blob/master/documentation/docu_en.adoc.

If you want to know more about the development history of the wiFred, skip ahead to <<background>> - otherwise read on with <<throttle>>.
